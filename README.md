# Suris Code Challenge

It was made with React and .NET C# given the company specifications.

## SetUp

Open Run.bat on the project root, it would check for dependencies and try to open both front and back-end parts of the project in a couple terminal windows automatically.

This project requires .Net SDK and NodeJS (including npm) to run.

if you want to run it youself, you would need to open Visual Studio 2022 (.NET 8) and open the solution inside the "Back" folder first. at that point, you should see button with the green arrow at the top to run the project;
but in case you want to run teh command on the terminal anyway, here it is:

```bash
npm run dev
```

After that, you should open Visual Studio Code (or the IDE of your choice) and open the "Front" folder on root.

Once opened, open a new terminal instance (either inside your ide or not) make sure you are at the "Front" folder, and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
cd src
npm run dev
```
Usage of this code (either partial or total) for other uses than the original is discouraged.
